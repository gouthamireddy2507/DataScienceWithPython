         "how do films like mouse hunt get into theatres ? \r\nisn't there a law or something ? \r\nthis diabolical load of claptrap from steven speilberg's dreamworks studio is hollywood family fare at its deadly worst . \r\nmouse hunt takes the bare threads of a plot and tries to prop it up with overacting and flat-out stupid slapstick that makes comedies like jingle all the way look decent by comparison . \r\nwriter adam rifkin and director gore verbinski are the names chiefly responsible for this swill . \r\nthe plot , for what its worth , concerns two brothers ( nathan lane and an appalling lee evens ) who inherit a poorly run string factory and a seemingly worthless house from their eccentric father . \r\ndeciding to check out the long-abandoned house , they soon learn that it's worth a fortune and set about selling it in auction to the highest bidder . \r\nbut battling them at every turn is a very smart mouse , happy with his run-down little abode and wanting it to stay that way . \r\nthe story alternates between unfunny scenes of the brothers bickering over what to do with their inheritance and endless action sequences as the two take on their increasingly determined furry foe . \r\nwhatever promise the film starts with soon deteriorates into boring dialogue , terrible overacting , and increasingly uninspired slapstick that becomes all sound and fury , signifying nothing . \r\nthe script becomes so unspeakably bad that the best line poor lee evens can utter after another run in with the rodent is : \" i hate that mouse \" . \r\noh cringe ! \r\nthis is home alone all over again , and ten times worse . \r\none touching scene early on is worth mentioning . \r\nwe follow the mouse through a maze of walls and pipes until he arrives at his makeshift abode somewhere in a wall . \r\nhe jumps into a tiny bed , pulls up a makeshift sheet and snuggles up to sleep , seemingly happy and just wanting to be left alone . \r\nit's a magical little moment in an otherwise soulless film . \r\na message to speilberg : if you want dreamworks to be associated with some kind of artistic credibility , then either give all concerned in mouse hunt a swift kick up the arse or hire yourself some decent writers and directors . \r\nthis kind of rubbish will just not do at all . \r\n"

         "according to hollywood movies made in last few decades , life in small town is one of the worst things that could happen to a human being . \r\neven worse fate awaits those who were unfortunate to grow up in those dark , god-forsaken places and later forced to live forever traumatised by the experience . \r\non the other hand , it seems that something more than atlantic ocean divides europe from america , because one of the most popular and beloved european films takes exactly the opposite view . \r\nthis film is amarcord , 1974 comedy by famous italian director federico fellini , which later gave inspiration to numerous imitations and homages , and even led few american screen artists to adopt its heretical views about benefits of small town life . \r\nthe film is based on the screenplay by fellini and tonino guerra and it lacks the plot in usual sense . \r\ninstead we follow one year in 1930s italian summer resort town of rimini through the series of short vignettes that depict various local events and customs , as well as series of local , often very colourful characters . \r\nalthough many of those characters occasionally take the role of narrator , movie concentrates on its nominal protagonist , 14-year old boy titta ( played by bruno zanin ) and chronicles his sexual frustrations , obsession with local beauty queen named gradisca ( played by magali noel ) , problems in his lovingly dysfunctional family , as well as troubles his father ( played by armando brancia ) have with mussolini's fascist regime . \r\namarcord was often noted as the ultimate nostalgia film , and it probably explains why it is very popular , even among those people who actually don't like federico fellini's work very much . \r\nevery member of its potential audience would find part of himself or herself in this film , because fellini in this film clearly illustrates natural human desire to paint past in the best way possible . \r\ndistortion between actual past and its subjective interpretation could be found even in the title of the film - word \" amarcord \" is nothing more than badly pronounced phrase \" i remember \" in local italian dialect . \r\nin the same way the word is distorted , so is the past in memories of those who remember it . \r\nafter the premiere , fellini rejected any claims about autobiographical character of this film , but it doesn't matter whether rimini of amarcord actually resembles rimini of fellini's childhood or not ; any place and any time could resemble characters and situations of this film . \r\nfellini's views on nostalgia are clearly illustrated with a way he mixes reality and fantasy in this film . \r\neven the most naturalistic scenes are laced with dark humour and grotesque images . \r\ncharacters look like caricatures , actors playing them often deliberately overact , and women , especially those who fuel titta's sexual fantasies , often have certain body parts with gargantuan proportions . \r\nevery now and then , scenes that depict 1930s reality gradually slide into fantasies of movie's characters and rimini becomes almost indistinguishable from the magical place in characters' visions . \r\nbecause of that , almost everything in this film looks different , and in most cases better , than it would have looked in the real life . \r\neven the fascism gets fellinian make-over - fellini views mussolini's totalitarian regime as nothing more than visual spectacle ( explaining why similar regimes enjoyed such popular support throughout history ) and opportunity for comedy . \r\nwhen fascists finally show their true colours and begin torturing their opponents , even this becomes opportunity for scenes of macabre humour . \r\nunlike many of his italian colleagues in 1970s , who had used 1930s period setting to explicitly condemn fascism and serve fashionable political agenda , fellini doesn't care that much about politics . \r\nlack of self-righteous moral perspective is compensated with fellini's humanistic approach to his characters . \r\neach of them , regardless of age , gender , social class or physical appearance , is given opportunity to express his or her views , dreams and fears . \r\nfellini treats all those characters with warmth and affection , even when he paints them as grotesque caricatures of real people . \r\nbecause of this warmth and democratic spirit , amarcord could be viewed as one of the most humane films of 20th century , and it keeps its general feel good atmosphere despite depicting having many uncomfortable , melancholic and even tragic moments . \r\nfellini couldn't produce such effects without using his own directorial talent that gave a very personal touch to this movie . \r\nvignettes aren't memorable because of the characters only ; fellini uses camera , painting film in bright colours , especially in the scenes that depict character's fantasies . \r\nfellini also knows how to use locations , whether such location happens to be luxurious hotel , bright-coloured beach or rural countryside . \r\neven the down-to-earth streets of rimini , where everyone knows everyone , gets magical dimension during the snowfall . \r\non the other hand , lack of credible special effects somewhat diminished the same effect during the ocean liner scene . \r\nthis atmosphere is also provided by incredible talent of composer and fellini's long-time associate nino rota . \r\nhis amarcord theme is probably one of the most recognisable , most popular and most relaxing and uplifting pieces of film music ever produced . \r\nthat music alone should be the reason to view amarcord as one of the indisputable classics of seventh art . \r\n"

         "my first press screening of 1998 and already i've gotten a prime candidate for my worst ten of the year list . \r\nwhat an auspicious beginning ! \r\nwelcome to the dog days of winter when the only film openings of merit are those oscar contenders that the studios opened in late december in new york and l . a . and which are just now beginning to appear elsewhere . \r\nfirestorm , the directorial debut of dances with wolves's academy award winning cinematographer dean semler , is the first of the new year's crop of movies . \r\nas our story opens , the movie pretentiously informs us that of the tens of thousands of firefighters only 400 are \" smokejumpers . \" \r\nwe then cut to a plane load of smoke jumping cowboys and one cowgirl , where one of the gung-ho guys is taking a romance quiz from \" cosmopolitan . \" \r\nhaving the time of their lives , they then jump into the middle of a burning forest . \r\nwhen , even in the beginning , the director can't get the small parts right , you can sense the movie is in trouble . \r\nwith the noisy fire roaring all about them and with the trapped people huddled near their gasoline-filled cars , smokejumper monica ( christianne hirt ) tells them to get away from their soon-to-explode vehicles . \r\nnot bothering to shout nor even get close to them , she announces her warning without raising her voice much or approaching the people . \r\nmiraculously , they manage to hear her and move away . \r\nin a movie that specializes in cheap shots , the camera locates the proverbial young girl trapped in a nearby burning building . \r\nas it does throughout , overly dramatic cinematographer stephen f . windon from the postman uses extremely fast zooms right down to the endangered girl's face . \r\nour show's two heroes , the crew's chief , wynt perkins , played laconically by scott glenn , and his second-in-command , jesse graves , played by howie long in a weak attempt to be the next steven seagal , enter the burning house looking for the little girl . \r\nin a panic they have difficulty in locating her before they are engulfed in flames . \r\nthe manipulative script has her hidden in her own dollhouse . \r\nthis mawkish show cuts back to monica , who has a life-or-death decision to make . \r\nthe chopper with the fire-retardant chemicals has only enough to save one group . \r\nwill it be the large group near the cars or the helpless little girl and monica's two firefighting buddies ? \r\nshe has only seconds to decide who will be saved . \r\nyes , she goes for the majority , but , miracle of miracles , the other three come out alive anyway . \r\nnot content with a traditional firefighting story , chris soth's screenplay attempts to jazz it up by having william forsythe from palookaville play a vicious killer named randy earl shaye who sets a forest fire so that he can join the crew to put it out and then escape . \r\n ( \" hoods in the woods , \" is what the \" ground-pounders \" yell out when the convicts are bused in to help them fight the fire . ) \r\nalong the way , shaye picks up an ornithologist hostage played by suzy amis , who turns out to have been trained in warrior ways by her father , who was a marine drill instructor . \r\nmost of the highly predictable movie is a long chase in which poor howie long is given one ridiculous stunt after another to look silly performing . \r\nhe flings a chain saw backwards over his head while riding a speeding motorcycle so that the saw can hit the windshield of the pursuing truck . \r\narguably the low point is when he escapes from a locked burning building by riding a motorcycle conveniently parked inside . \r\nusing a ramp , he shoots straight out of the top of the building's attic , and when he hits the ground , he just rides off in a cloud of dust . \r\nwhen the film isn't using some stock footage of actual forest fires , the simulated ones look hokey . \r\neditor jack hofstra cheapens the action even more by his use of burning flames in scene transitions . \r\nthe ending , with its sick twists , manages to be even worse than the rest of the movie . \r\nperhaps the best that can be said for the picture is the faint praise i heard afterwards in the lobby , \" it's not as bad as some of the television sitcoms . \" \r\nfirestorm runs mercifully just 1 : 29 . \r\nit is rated r for violence and language and would be acceptable for teenagers . \r\n"
